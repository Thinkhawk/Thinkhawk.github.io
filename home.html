				As we all know the present scenario of the entire world seems to be very tragic due to the outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus. In this situation the entire humankind is going through a very pathetic phase in all possible ways. People are starving without food and a whole lot of them are totally clueless about the gravity of the situation. People are not only being afffected by the Virus but also in many other ways. There is a shortage of basic daily needs due to the break in the supply chain which includes food, medicine etc. Thus we have collaborated with ForHumanity to help our fellow beings out there whose day to day lifestyle has changed due to all the above reasons. Our main objectives are to identify people who are struggling to get basic amenities (like food and medicine) and reporting and reacting to the same, spreading positivity and to make sure that voiceless creatures around us aren't left to starve.
